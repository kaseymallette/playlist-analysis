# playlist-analysis

This project explores whether songs curated to express a morally assertive or judgment-oriented stance share measurable audio and popularity characteristics. Using a human-curated Spotify playlist as a labeled dataset, the analysis examines relationships between audio features (e.g., valence, energy, acousticness, loudness) and track popularity to identify clustering patterns that may reflect emotional stance, intensity, or social reception.

The goal is not to infer lyrical meaning directly, but to test whether audio structure alone carries signals associated with morally charged expression. Lyrics analysis is considered future work.
